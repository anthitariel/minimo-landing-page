🚀 Minimo Landing Page

A modern, responsive, and cross-browser compatible landing page built from a professional PSD design. This project utilizes a standard front-end stack (HTML, CSS, JS) integrated with a lightweight Python Flask backend for handling form submissions and serving the application.

✨ Features

Fully Responsive Design: Adapts flawlessly across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) using Flexbox and CSS Grid.

Smooth Navigation: Fixed header and smooth scrolling anchor links for excellent user experience.

Interactive UI: Pricing cards highlight on selection, and the header collapses into a mobile-friendly hamburger menu.

Functional Contact Form: Integrated with a Python Flask API to handle and process form submissions asynchronously.

Modern Development: Written with clean HTML5 semantics, modular CSS, and ES6+ JavaScript.
